// Graphs
// A graph is a data structure comprised of a set of nodes, also known as vertices, and a set of edges. Each node in a graph may point to any other node in the graph. This is very useful for things like describing networks, creating related nonhierarchical data, and as we will see in the lesson, describing the relationships within one's family.
